  <title>Quality Zen Configuration Files</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p><em>Everything that you always wanted to know about the
    <strong>Configuration File</strong>:</em>
  </p>
  <p>All program configuration directives are set in the config file.</p>

  <p>Configuration files contain several sections that each have the
    following format:
  </p>
  <tt>
  <table border="0">
    <tr>
      <td> &nbsp;</td><td>[section]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> &nbsp;</td><td>option=value<br>&hellip;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </tt>

  <p><em>For example:</em></p>
  <tt>
  <table border="0">
    <tr>
      <td> &nbsp;</td>
      <td>[Query]<br>
        query = RANGE<br>
        range = 295111,415333<br>
        organization = Mozilla<br>
        base_url = https://api-dev.bugzilla.mozilla.org/latest<br>
        <br>
        [Database]<br>
        database = bugzilla<br>
        collection = issues<br>
        <br>
        [Metrics]<br>
        m_all = off<br>
        m_ttr = on<br>
        m_mdr = on<br>
        m_ddr = on<br>
        <br>
        [Dashboard]<br>
        dashpath = ../dashres/
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </tt>

  <p>Section and option names are set by the program.  &nbsp;Option values
    are the responsibility of the user.  &nbsp;However, values for the query
    option come from a fixed set, as described on the
    <a href="./cfgquery.html" title="Query Configuration">Query Configuration
    details page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Each section is discussed in detail in the pages
    referenced below.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="./cfgquery.html" title="Query Configuration">
        Query Section
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="./cfgdb.html" title="Database Configuration">
        Database Section
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="./cfgmetric.html" title="Metrics Configuration">
        Metrics Section
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="./cfgdashbd.html" title="Dashboard Configuration">
        Dashboard Section
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>All configuration information is specified in the configuration
        file.
      </li>
      <li>Option/Value pair lines can be commented out with the '#'
        character.  &nbsp;These lines are then ignored by the config file
        parser.
      </li>
      <li>Option/Value pairs are just that, "pairs".  &nbsp;Don't specify an
        option and leave the value field blank.  &nbsp;This is an undefined
        condition.  &nbsp;We'll try to handle it gracefully, but it would
        be nice if you just didn't do that.
      </li>
      <li>If you don't have an external source for issues, you must have a
        database containing issue information.
      </li>
